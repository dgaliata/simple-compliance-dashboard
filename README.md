# Simple Compliance Dashboard

Security Dashboard Data Entry & Export Tool I built that can take data input and export results in PDF format. This specific HTML code is focused on a work project but can be changed to incorporate several aspects of security.

**This is still a bit manual. I get that, but it's better than a spreadsheet. I might look at extending this or adding more features to it in the future.**
